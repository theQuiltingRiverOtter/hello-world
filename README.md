A basic repository to store ideas, assignments, and notes


I am in the process of learning computer science, command line, web development and other programming languages.  I've recently begun taking college courses for a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.  As a part of several side projects, to include doing the coursework for Harvard's open courseware CS50 and The Odin Project, I needed a GITHUB account.  This repository was created as the initial learning repository for GITHUB according to GITHUB's guides.  I will use it to store ideas for new websites or programming projects, for assignment details, and to take any other notes I feel is necessary.
