A basic repository to store ideas, assignments, and notes


I am in the process of learning computer science, command line, web development and other programming languages.  I've recently begun taking college courses for a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.  As a part of several side projects, to include doing the coursework for Harvard's open courseware CS50 and The Odin Project, I needed a GITHUB account.  This repository was created as the initial learning repository for GITHUB according to GITHUB's guides.  I will use it to store ideas for new websites or programming projects, for assignment details, and to take any other notes I feel is necessary.  


Ideas:
A website devoted to cyber security for children.  It will include lessons and tests about how to be secure both on their personal computers and online, how to be good internet citizens, etc.  Everything should be simple and explained so a first grader can understand it.  Use lots of animations, pictures, videos, etc. 

Dinosaur Stock Game:
Invest in a dinosaur theme park. Each dinosaur will be tied to a real-life stock, and their investments in the dinosaurs will rise and fall with the actual stock.

Application for walking/running to a location.  Tracks your distance ran and adds it to previous distances until you hit a particular place such as rivendale, the moon, etc.

Bobiverse Game:
  Start with a bob, choose to explore, replicate, colonize.  Must save human civilation, defeate Maderos and the others, study new life.
  
Colonization Games:
