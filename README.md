A basic repository to store ideas, assignments, and notes


This repository was created as the initial learning repository for GITHUB according to GITHUB's guides.  I will use it to store ideas for new websites or programming projects, for assignment details, and to take any other notes I feel is necessary.  


Ideas:
Website for playing solo journal RPG. This application would allow players to play popular solo journal RPGs online and save their journal entries to a database. For example, the game "Alone Among the Stars" is usually played with a deck of cards and a die." The player rolls the die to determine how many cards to use in a playing session, and the cards themselves determine the journal prompts.

Flashcard application for Chinese: This would work like any other flashcard application, but would provide three 'sides' as opposed to two. Chinese learners must learn the characters, romanized pronunciation, and english for each term seperately. Most flashcard apps force the learner to put the pronunciation and english on one side of the card, making it easier to figure out the definition when doing matching games or to know the Chinese when going from English to Chinese. This hurts their learning. This application would have buttons to change from the Chinese, pronunciation, and English. 

A website devoted to cyber security for children.  It will include lessons and tests about how to be secure both on their personal computers and online, how to be good internet citizens, etc.  Everything should be simple and explained so a first grader can understand it.  Use lots of animations, pictures, videos, etc. 

Dinosaur Stock Game:
Invest in a dinosaur theme park. Each dinosaur will be tied to a real-life stock, and their investments in the dinosaurs will rise and fall with the actual stock. It would also teach people about investment topics/ideas.

Application for walking/running to a location.  Tracks your distance ran and adds it to previous distances until you hit a particular place such as rivendale, the moon, etc.

Bobiverse Game:
  Start with a bob, choose to explore, replicate, colonize.  Must save human civilation, defeate Maderos and the others, study new life.
  
  Artist Shop website for husband's artwork.
